# [Attribute] Module
Covers all attributes that are used in calculations

### Core Attributes

1. **Health (HP)** - Determines the amount of damage a character can withstand before being defeated.
2. **Attack** - Governs the power of physical moves, affecting the damage output for physical attacks.
3. **Defense** - Reduces incoming damage from physical attacks, increasing survivability against physical attackers.
4. **Special Attack** - Governs the power of special moves, affecting the damage output for special-based attacks.
5. **Special Defense** - Reduces incoming damage from special attacks, adding durability against special-based attackers.
6. **Speed** - Determines the turn order in battles. Higher speed allows a character to attack first.

### Secondary Attributes (Impact Battle Mechanics)

1. **Critical Hit Chance** - Probability of landing a critical hit, dealing extra damage (often 1.5x or 2x normal damage).
2. **Accuracy** - The base chance for moves to hit the opponent; higher accuracy reduces the likelihood of missing.
3. **Evasion** - The likelihood of dodging incoming attacks. High evasion counters opponents with lower accuracy.
4. **Stamina/Energy** - Resource pool for performing moves. Moves deplete stamina; if it’s too low, the character might need to “rest” or switch.

### Elemental Affinities (Resistance and Weakness Attributes)

1. **Elemental Affinities** - Defines resistances and weaknesses to specific elements (Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, etc.), affecting damage taken from those elements. Some characters may also have complete immunity to certain types (e.g., immunity to Poison).
2. **Condition Resistances** - Probability of resisting certain status effects (e.g., Burn, Freeze, Paralyze), where a high resistance reduces the likelihood or duration of these effects.

### Advanced Attributes (For Enhanced Strategic Depth)

1. **Cooldown Reduction** - Reduces the wait time for specific moves, making powerful moves available more frequently.
2. **Lifesteal** - A percentage of damage dealt that restores the attacker’s HP. Useful for sustained combat.
3. **Reflect/Shield** - Absorbs a set amount of damage for a certain period or until broken by an opponent's attack.
4. **Penetration** - Ignores a portion of the opponent’s Defense or Special Defense, useful against high-defense characters.
5. **Block Chance** - A percentage chance to block an attack entirely or reduce its effectiveness.
6. **Buff Duration** - Affects the length of time positive statuses remain active (e.g., Attack Up, Speed Up).
7. **Debuff Duration** - Affects the length of time negative statuses last on the opponent when inflicted.

### Situational or Conditional Attributes (Adds Unique Battle Tactics)

1. **Counterattack Rate** - Chance to retaliate automatically when hit, dealing a percentage of incoming damage back.
2. **Focus Power** - Enhances critical hit chance or power temporarily after consecutive successful moves.
3. **Combo Multiplier** - Increases damage with consecutive successful hits, useful for aggressive battle styles.
4. **Cooldown Reduction** - Speeds up access to specific high-power moves after usage, beneficial for strategic play.
5. **Final Stand** - Grants a chance to survive an otherwise fatal hit with 1 HP remaining.

### Unique or Special Attributes (Customized, Rare Abilities)

1. **Elemental Amplification** - Boosts effectiveness of moves of a specific element (e.g., Fire moves hit harder).
2. **Elemental Absorption** - Instead of taking damage, absorbs and heals from specific elemental attacks.
3. **Retribution** - Increases damage output after taking damage, rewarding risky playstyles.
4. **Charge Power** - Stores energy with each action or turn, powering up certain moves based on stored energy.
5. **Adaptability** - Raises effectiveness of a move used repeatedly or modifies attacks based on opponent attributes.
6. **Aura** - Grants a team-wide buff or aura, impacting the effectiveness of certain moves or statuses for all team members.
